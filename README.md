PNGvsJPEG
=========

This is a simple benchmark app to compare JPEG vs PNG loading performance on iOS. Spoiler: JPEG wins.

Note: To get an accurate result, ensure that you do the following:

1) Run on a device, not the simulator
2) Build in release mode, not debug
3) Disconnect from the debugger / Xcode
4) Kill the app and re-run a few times to verify
